  ## SHORT OVERVIEW
  
  This update mostly contains structural improvements, cleanups and minor fixes.
  
  ## NEW RULES:
  - Added a rule to detect 4-white socket triad grip gloves.
  
  ## TIERING ADJUSTMENTS:
  - All tierlists have been adjusted based on the current economy:
  - This currently includes the following tierlists: Uniques, Divination Cards, Fragments (incl. splinters), Currency (incl. stacked currency and shards), Scarabs, Unique Maps, Fossils, Incubators, Oils, Vials, Delirium Orbs, Invitations, Influenced Items, Expensive Atlas Bases, Cluster Jewels, Breachstones, Replicas and Gems.
  
  ## MISC IMPROVEMENTS AND FIXES:
  - Fixed a bug where early endgame 4links (arealevel 68-71) with 4links would also match uniques. This only affected soft and regular strictness.
  - Most places that have been requiring an item to not be corrupted also now require the non-mirrored state
  - The low tier quality flask rule now requires the flask to be normal
