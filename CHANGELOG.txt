----------------------------------
NeverSink's itemfilter - version 4.6 - Legacy League - Major update
----------------------------------

Features:

- Retiered and repriced all uniques.
- Retiered divination cards and added 2 new cards to the tierlists
- Adjusted the leveling section a lot. It now has better highlights for 4L, useful racing gear, some flasks, "brutus-killing-equip" etc.
- Adjusted the chance bases
- Completely reworte the map tier lists. The new map tier list shows low tier maps, and highlights them, WHEN you are in lowtier maps. Once you outlevel the map drops (7 levels difference between the droptier and the itemlevel) the map becomes "greyed out" and hidden on high strictness version of the lootfilter. The exceptions are maps of tier 10 or higher (never hidden) and all shaped maps.
- Adjusted several colors, settings, lot's and lot's of finetuning
- Gems with 14%+ qual are now more visible
- Lot's of minor adjustments to the structure, that improve the performance and allow me to generate the filters easier.
- Fixed the blue/slick styles, sometimes still having some "old" green backgrounds.
- Added a new "streamsound" style, that has an alt. soundsscheme - it's designed for streamers and streamviewers to not get confused when the other side find a good item.
- Adjusted the rare tierlist towards the upcoming economy
- Adjusted the crafting bases towards the upcoming economy
- Made the semi-strict filter more strict towards 2-handed and bulky bases. 
- Some stylistic and performance improvements - updated my tools to use "tierlists" that group together different levels, basetypes, classes for easier editing

----------------------------------
NeverSink's itemfilter - version 4.5 new version, major meta and toolchain adjustments.
----------------------------------

- Refined **all** filters to match the meta/economy more
- Adjusted the unique tier list
- Renamed the filenames a tiny bit so that they're ordered correctly.
- Added a new version: "Very Strict". It's about as strict as the old Uber-Strict, but fits the economy better. If you liked Uber-Strict before, you should probably stick to this version now.
- The Uber-Strict filter is now even **more** strict (double-dips!) and only shows the meta-rares.
- The strictness gap between Regular<->Semi-Strict has been increased a bit, while the one between Semi-Strict<->Strict decreased a bit.
- Improved my mini-toolchain to allow quicker and more frequent updates
- Adjusted font-sizes to be slightly more uniform

Feature Balance:

- Finetuned the T1-rares to match the meta. They're mostly consisting out of ES items.
- Added the T1.5 rares. These rares are shown in every version, but will have a black background in the Uber-Strict version instead of green.
- Finetuned the T2-rares to match the meta.
- Finetuned the good/ok/bad rare balance. It's more strict in general.
- Reworked the dagger tier lists (more high tier daggers shown)
- Reworked the sceptre tier lists (Void and Sambar sceptre are now T2 bases)
- Harbingers and spike-point quivers moved a tier down.
- ILVL 84 Steel/Opal/Crystal belts now give off the T1 Drop sound
- Refined the section handling rare Atlas bases
- Chancing items now have priority over the regular crafting section. However, the 84+ crafting section still has priority over the chancing items
- Removed Jewelled foil from the T1 crafting (and crafting rare) items to the T2 crafting items.
- Fixed several minor bugs
- Added 20% qual. shields/daggers to the 20% section
- Removed a few redundant entries
- Changed the default "Animated Weapon"-items appearance. The items are now way small, because most meta-AW builds rely on cast while channelling or totems.
- Potential warband items and corrupted white amulets/belts (for "corrupted alchemy darkshrine" in labs) are not shown by default on the Very Strict and higher versions (still shown if you hold alt.)
- Made the hidden items even smaller. (the ones you see while holding ALT)

----------------------------------
NeverSink's itemfilter - version 4.43 minor update
----------------------------------

- Added the divination cards to the tierlists
- The regular filter now displays the two-stone/onyx/diamond trinkets starting with level 60.
- Minor change to T2 currency visuals (still experimenting).

----------------------------------
NeverSink's itemfilter - version 4.42 economy/polishing update
----------------------------------

- Removed the Unique T2 Lapis Amulet from the tierlists.

----------------------------------
NeverSink's itemfilter - version 4.41 economy/polishing update
----------------------------------

- Due to popular request the priority chancing section is no longer hidden in the strict version (uberstrict still hides it)
- Added the Spiraled Foils to the good rare items.


----------------------------------
NeverSink's itemfilter - version 4.4 economy/polishing update
----------------------------------

I've attempted to work with Poe.Ninja instead of Poe.Trade for the price checking of different uniques/divination cards. I initially like the results.

CHANGES:

- Retiered all divination cards to better fit the current economy
- Retiered all uniques to better fit the current economy
- Increased the itemsizes of several low-mid tier orbs to fit the breach pinatas and the clearspeed meta
- Alterations, chance, jeweler and chromatic orbs now have more highlight ( https://imgur.com/a/0f1D6 )
- Added all corrupted belts to the show-list (amulets already there).
- You can now again click alt to check the ground for warband items (you don't need to do it in the T13/T15 maps)

BUGFIXES: 

- Fixed the highlight for finished "Breachstone" items. The official information is that they are "Map Fragments". They are not. This is client-side a bug. It's not major, but worth investigating to prevent future problems /u/GGG_Bex
- ilvl75+ Spike point quivers now have the correct textcolor
- ilvl75+ 6S armors now have the correct textcolor
- Restructured a tiny bit - leather belts (for chancing) are now visible 

----------------------------------
NeverSink's itemfilter - version 4.31 minor bugfixes and improvements
----------------------------------

- Added leather belts to the chancing lists
- Quality gems with less than 14 quality now have a border again (oops)
- ilvl 50+ crudebows for SRS crafting now only get the green border if they're non-unique

----------------------------------
NeverSink's itemfilter - version 4.3 breach & architecture overhaul
----------------------------------

Special thanks to GGG and Bex&Jonathan in specific for forwarding and answering my questions about the filtering algorithm. You guys rock!

STYLES:

- The filter now supports styles!
- Styles are alternative filters, with the same 4 strictness versions (regular, semi-strict...), but with different visuals
- The Slick Filter - is now a whole style and has all 4 strictness versions!
- Added new style: (BLUE) - same as regular, bad rares have a transparent background and good rares a blue one. First style to test the feature :)
- The styles are located in folders, starting with (STYLE)

CHANGES:

- Added breach rings
- Added breachstones, breach blessings (shouldn't those be curses, I mean those guys are kinda hellish), splinters
- Added vaal breach with a little bit of extra highlight
- Revamped the warband item section. 
- ILVL 82 identified, noncorrupted boots and helmets and ILVL 84 sceptres, wands and daggers will be treated as warband items and will have a light purple border
- Adjusted some colors
- Made the filter a bit stricter
- Reworked the crafting tier list - removed less demanded items, added foils
- Moved rare foils up several tiers
- Adjusted divination card tier list
- Adjusted unique tier list
- Removed dropsounds from lvl1 and 2 essences
- Moved journeyman sextants up a tier

STRUCTURE:

- Completely reworked the filter structure - based on the official information provided by GGG_Jonathan
- The new structure should be -significantly- faster. I suspect that the time needed to classify an endgame drop is 10 times smaller or even faster. This is a buff.
- Added a polished table of contents, that is auto-updated, thanks to a little C# tool.
- The filter syntax is a LOT more cleaner and commented now. The filter file has become a tiny bit larger, but this should not affect performance, since comments are not only parsed during the initial load (confirmed by GGG_Jonathan)
- Added comments and descriptions to every visual identifier: those are autoupdated, thanks to the same tool.
- The filter now supports alternative stylesheets (guess the tool). Those are located in folders called (STYLE) *stylename* and also have the 4 basic subversions (regular, semistrict, strict, uberstrict)
- The stylesheets are also kept up to date and provide the filter with a different appearance.
- For now only the "blue" stylesheet is added. More stylesheets coming soon.
- The new filter structure is easier to edit for users and easier to maintain for me
- Fixed several rare bugs

STYLE:

- Polished up the appearance of the filter thanks to the stylesheets. Removed or grouped similar colors, to provide a more uniform, polished appearance
- Implemented the new warband items. Identified boots and helmets of the ilvl 82 and sceptres, daggers and wands of the ilvl 84 will now appear with a special border
- Fix a few bugs.

PS: The raw alpha version of my FilterPolish tool can be found on: https://github.com/NeverSinkDev/Filterpolish-Release

----------------------------------
NeverSink's itemfilter - version 4.2 (for POE 2.4/atlas POLISHING UPDATE)
----------------------------------

**GENERAL** :

NOTE: The slick version is not updated in this version. Reason can be found below.

I've finally finished a small tool that auto-generates non-regular versions for me, allowing me to update easier, safer, introduce better filtering mechanics (as seen in this update) into the non-regular versions and potentially have more versions.

This update improves the filtering of the semi-strict/strict/UBERstrict a lotversions, reintroduces warband helmets markup (high level only, see below), adds a new block for highlighting selected 6S ilvl 84/83 items, slighlty improves the markup of maps and currency and fixes some bugs.

The next update will enable me to have easy stylesheet and color-table generations, I'll update the slick version, once it's done.

**Filterversions** :

- **Regular** - displays all rares
- **Semi-Strict** - hides all "*/bad rares" in the endgame and also all "clunky/ok" rares. Also hides clunky chromatic recipes, still shows gavels and a very small asortment of crafting trinkets (twostone, onyx, diamond)
- **Strict** - hides all non-good and even the good/2h items that are not top-tier. Recommended for large parties and heavy magic find characters. NOT recommended for beginners.
- **UBER-Strict** - [**NEW**] Crazy filtering level. You've been warned. It displays only the Creme de la Creme. Hides >90% rares, portals, wisdoms, armorers, agumentations, most recipes etc.
- **Slick** - same as regular, however less colors.

You can get more information and the filter itself:

Or you can get the filter directely from my GITHUB

If you want the notepad++ highlighting you can also find it on GITHUB

**NOTE:** Currently there exists a bug, that causes some fonts to appear weird ("empty boxes", distance between letters distant or wrong letters). This bug is caused by the POE engine itself and is not related to the filter (it can happen with other filters or even without them in other game parts too). If this happens to you: restart the game and it should be all gone. Please stop E-Mailing me about it, there's sadly nothing I can do, since this is client-related. GGG is aware of the bug.

----------------------------------
CHANGELOG:
----------------------------------

**CONTENT:**

- Added the UBER-strict version. You can find more details in the version description above.
- The code is now even more tidy, displays correctly in NotePad and is easier to keep up-to-date.
- Improved the filtering of the Semi-Strict version. It's a little bit more strict now
- Improved the filtering of the Strict version. It now differs between top tier and other items (the other items have no green backgrounds)
- The strict version now has a significantly smaller 83/84 crafting item list.
- Added Kris to the crafting lists
- Updated all versions to switch to non-leveling-mode at level 66. The dried lake is now a tiny bit cleaner. 
- Added 4 cards to the "trash-tier" divination cards (hermit, king's blade, prosperity, metalsmith's gift). They no longer give off sounds. I apologize if this upsets the creaters of those cards.
- Added new section that highlights selected ilvl 83/84 bases.
- Added a section for redblade warband helmets. To see them, you have to click alt/F (or whatever the key to display hidden items is for you). Magic helmets (ilvl 80+) will get highlighted in a red hue. Note that this affects ALL helmets, no matter who dropped them. Only use this when fighting redblade warbands (beacon map). If you want to enable other warbands you can do it in the code manually

**VISUAL:**

- Changed up some item-sizes (maps mostly to distinguish different map tiers better)
- Low maps have a weaker background
- Mid-High currency (chaos, vaal, regret, GCP, regal and some special ones) have a slightly more orangish hue on drop. -  I'm considering reintroducing the GONG sound on those, feedback welcome.

**SOUNDS:**

- Guardian map fragments don't give off the high-tier-item sound anymore (they still have the white background). The drop is expected and takes away a bit excitement.

**BUGFIXES:**

- This and that. I programmed 7 hours straight today and totally forgot what else I did o_O
