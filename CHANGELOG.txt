----------------------------------
NeverSink's itemfilter - version 5.72
----------------------------------

- Colossal Tower Shields added to ilvl 86 T1 bases
- Crystal/Vanguard belts added to Shaper/Elder T1 bases

----------------------------------
NeverSink's itemfilter - version 5.71
----------------------------------

- Imprints added for the beastiary recipe

----------------------------------
NeverSink's itemfilter - version 5.7 - Crafting, Rares and Special Bases update
----------------------------------

**Crafting/Special Bases:** The past leagues and expansions have made the access to high level item bases significantly easier, while decreasing their usefulness and adding new special bases and crafting types. This decreases their value and usefulness significantly. This filter update decreases their highlight in order to create a cleaner screen, represent this development and unify their colours to free up more color space for future leagues. (The following rules do NOT affect shaper/elder/leveling rules):

- Introduced a new "Special Purpose base Color". It's more or less cyan and is used for abyss belts, atlas bases, warband bases, 5Ls, 3W offhand weapons, SRS Crude bows and other more or less non-frequent drops. It frees up a lot of color-space and serves as a precurser for the upcoming style update.
- Split the ilvl 86 crafting bases (normal, magic, rare) into T1 and T2 bases (T1 bases are "Onyx Amulet" "Diamond Ring" "Two-Stone Ring" "Unset Ring" "Eternal Burgonet" "Lion Pelt")
- Reduced the highlight of ILVL 84 and 86 bases (the yellow/orange is less bright)
- Reduced the highlight of low level crafting bases
- Semi-Strict no longer shows early map crafting rings/amulets/belts
- Disabled the old identified helmets/boots warband entries. These have been made obsolete by shaper/elder bases. They can still be seen by showing hidden items and can still be enabled on filterblade
- Slightly reduced the highlight of SRS crude bows

**Rare items:** The meta now is *slightly* slower than usual (people tend to run higher maps and farm elder/shaper/guardians, instead of ONLY chaining shaped maps) and has more preference for armour/life items. On top of that the league doesn't have loot-explosion mechanics like abyss/breach. This allows adding a few additional (mostly small) rares to the T1 and T2 tiers. This change also slightly help with the alchemy orb shortage.

- (T2->T1) "Corsair Sword" has made it into T1 rares. Congratulation Corsair sword
- (T1->T2) "Colossal Tower Shield" "Cardinal Round Shield" "Sambar Sceptre" are going down from T1 to T2. Spectral Shield Poke was a flop, so their price is low. Ele damage sceptres are much more useful than pen sceptres due to the high RF player count. I'm not 100% convinced about the sambar change and will monitor the prices closely
- (T2->T1) "Vaal Gauntlets" "Goliath Greaves"
- (T3->T2) "Ancient Greaves" "Ancient Gauntlets" "Ezomyte Burgonet"
- (T2->T1) I'm done arguing if Eternal or Royal Burgonet is the REAL T1 armour helmet, so they're both T1 now. 

Shaper/Elder Items:  I'm iteratively getting to a well defined, well adjustable point that allows me to represent the peaks in the shaper/elder basetype versus itemlevel value chart. I've also added some more general adjustments:

- Removed obsolete basetypes.
- Working towards automating the process of identifying valuable shaper/elder bases by datamining the economy stream [work in progress, special thank you to the patreon supporters]
- All rare Shaper/Elder items with a DropLevel (level requirement) of 62+ and an ItemLevel of 83+ are now treated as T2 elder/shaper items, have a darker background and make a (random unique item) dropsound.
- All shaper/elder rings/amulets/belts now have a dropsound and the rare tiny-item-border (not only ilvl 75+ compared to earlier).

Other Changes:

- Maximized the Font Size of T6-T10 shaped maps (43->45)
- Maximized the Font Size of non-tiered map fragments
- Maximized the Font Size of Multi-Base uniques
- Did some optimizations for high level atlas bases
- Steel, Iron and Rope nets are hidden on VeryStrict and up (I apologize for the XBOX players who had no way of hiding these until now. )
- Thaumturgical nets are hidden on UberStrict and up
- Necromancy nets are hidden on UberPlusStrict
- Xoph's Heart has been added to multi-base uniques. I honestly think that'll mostly just disappoint people, since ALL amber amulets dropped outside of a breach are anvils, yet I had to argue over this so often that I'm giving in. I really hope GGG will introduce an expensive amber amulet so that my conscience my rest in piece ( *the arguing included one person, who started a flamewar over it, didn't want to read the FAQ, that got him banned eventually, made **7** fake accounts ... proceeded flaming, flamed me per PM, got banned several times again. How the hell does Chris handle the fucking negativity, if people are already going CRAZY over a filter.* )
- Fixed some meta Tags and Comments (had no affect on actual filtering)
- Regular strictness shows Divine/Eternal Life and Mana flasks until ilvl 75 ( was 72 )

----------------------------------
NeverSink's itemfilter - version 5.64 - Tons of finetuning and improvements
----------------------------------

- Shaper and Elder item sections have been revamped. Updating these is very complicated, because of the changing trends and evolving economy. I tried a slightly different approach this time. It should better suit the beasty economy.
- Divination cards retiered to better match the current economy
- Uniques have been retiered to better match the current economy. This league's economy differs wildly from the previous league. I've added some more uniques to multi-base uniques (such as leath-belts) too.
- Added the new "DisableDropSound" command to non-necromancy tier nets. This is not currently modifiable on filterblade
- There have been some general changes to some colors in the filter. Silver coins now have a different appearnace. The appearance of nets has been changes a bit. Sextant tier currency now has a different look.
- Font sizes have been adjusted throughout the whole filter
- Normal rarity atlas bases are now less highlighted and hidden on strict+
- There have been some minor changes regarding strictness and crafting bases
- Rare item highlighting: There's an experimental rule to highlight rare T3/T4 4Linked Boots, Gloves and Helmets on low strictness versions. This should be quite useful during fresh league starts.
- Rare item highlighting: Added an experimental rule to highlight not otherwise highlighted chromatic recipe candidate rares. This mostly affects semi-strict.
- Added an exclusive rule for 5L6S items.
- Abyss jewels now receive extra highlighting at level 82 (down from 84)
- Annulment orbs are staying in the sextant section... for now. I'm keeping a close eye. (potentially the harbinger league availability is keeping their price lower)
- Removed belly of the beast from the chancing items
- Low priority crafting bases now have a more transparent background
- T16 Elder Maps now make the tier1 sound similar to other T16 maps and have a slightly different appearance.
- Changed the dropsound of non-top itemlevel Opal and Steel Rings

----------------------------------
NeverSink's itemfilter - version 5.63 - Necromancy nets and economy adjustments
----------------------------------

- Fixed necromancy net bug
- Adjusted net apperance
- Retiered all uniques to better match the economy
- Retiered all divination cards to better match the economy

----------------------------------
NeverSink's itemfilter - version 5.62 - Economy adjustments
----------------------------------

- Necromancy nets added

----------------------------------
NeverSink's itemfilter - version 5.61 - Hotfix ELDER maps
----------------------------------

- Added rule for unanounced command "ElderMap" for Elder Maps.

----------------------------------
NeverSink's itemfilter - version 5.6 - Bestiary League!
----------------------------------

- Added nets to the lootfilter. There's 4 tier of nets (Rope, Iron, Steel, Thauma).
- Added other new items to the filter (Elder and Beastiary Orbs)
- Added new divination cards
- Retiered uniques and divination cards. They represent a mix out of the economy from the start of the last league and the end of the last league (to highlight good early items and meta items both)
- Retiered the shields in the rare tier list
- Made semi-strict and strict a tiny bit stricter, when it comes to crafting bases.
- Adjusted Abyss items dropsounds
- Added back Leather Belt for Headhunter chancing. Other chancing bases were not changed.
- Minor improvemets

----------------------------------
NeverSink's itemfilter - version 5.5 - Shaper/Elder Item Overhaul, Lateleague Economy Update.
----------------------------------

- Designed a new Shaper/Elder section! The new Section has been written after studying the economy (ASC-based) for several hours (please kill me). It's now split into Shaper/Elder subsections and features 3 tiers. Low tier (random) Shaper/Elder items no longer make a dropsound. Please note that you can't curently hide any Shaper/Elder items. This is a (rather strange) limitation by GGG. Feel free to make them transparent instead though on www.FilterBlade.xyz ;). Feedback extremely welcome.

- Retiered all Divination cards. Several cards have been added to the T5 section (the "worst level" of divination cards)

- Abyss Jewels: While useful abyss jewels are not strictly superior or better than "old" jewels. I've normalized their handling: No longer have any dropsounds. They also have the same appearance as "old" jewels. Itemlevel 84+ Abyss jewels still have a red border. Magic Abyss jewels are hidden on Very Strict and higher strictness versions.

- Abyss Stygian Belts: Removed the dropsound of Stygian Vises below ItemLevel 86

- Map Handling: The "map outleveling" feature has been adjusted. Maps (under Tier 10, non shaped/unique) are now outleveled, if their area level is 8 levels (up from 7) under the level of the monster that dropped them (yes it's complicated). This behaviour can be adjusted on www.FilterBlade.xyz

- Map Handling: Uber-Plus-Strict no longer hides any low map tiers by default

- Retiered all Uniques Items.

----------------------------------
NeverSink's itemfilter - version 5.43 - Fixes and minor improvements
----------------------------------

- Fixed the off by one error that caused T10 shaped maps to appear like T11 maps

- Adjusted the divination card tier list

- Fixed some minor highlighting mistakes (such as ILVL 86 random flasks getting highlighted)

----------------------------------
NeverSink's itemfilter - version 5.42 - Shaped Maps, ILVL 86 mods, economy, elder/shaper items
----------------------------------

First things first: This should fix all problems with Shaped Maps - I hope.

This patch focuses on the following things: Shaper/Elder mods, new itemlevel 86 mods, problems with shaped maps, unique prices and divination card prices. It's quite critical and I recommend everyone to grab it. As usual: if you've done changes to the filter through FilterBlade, you can merge these changes into the latest update.

Rare and crafting items have received new rulesets to handle ItemLevel 86 items. Atlas, Shaper/Elder and Stygian items were adjusted to have their top tier items focus on itemlevel 86. I've also added T2 shaper/elder items, with a slightly more saturated blue background, that have the itemlevel 80+. It seems that most itemslots have itemlevel 80.

Keypoints: 

- Adjusted the filter again to work well with the new ShapedMap mod introduced in 3.1. I hope that'll solve all remaining problems. The lootsimulator on FilterBlade currently generates shapedmaps of a higher level than it's supposed to - we'll sort it out soon.

- Retiered all uniques, lots of items lost value (normal process for new leagues). You can find the exact changes in the comments. 

- Retiered all divination cards

- The leveling-only dropsound that indicates 4L drops no longer plays on semi-strict and higher

- Expanded the shaper/elder highlight to consider itemlevels better. It seems that the current "itemlevels for shaper/elder mods" are 80/84/85. Adjusted the item highlight accordigly. 

- Added highlight for itemlevel 86 items! It's all implemented but needs some polishing, that'll come with knowledge, over time.

 - Fixed some minor bugs


----------------------------------
NeverSink's itemfilter - version 5.41 - Abyss League Hotfix and Improvements
----------------------------------

- The new features introduced by GGG: "ShapedMap True" is bugged in combination with "DropLevel". Implemented a temporary workaround. It's ugly and limits filterblade customizing

- Retiered divination cards

- Retiered uniques

- Gave Stygian belts a green background

----------------------------------
NeverSink's itemfilter - version 5.4 - Abyss League Hype
----------------------------------

- Adjusted www.FilterBlade.xyz to work with all the new changes (maps, abyss jewels, shaper, elder items, new divination cards...)

- Added some goodies to www.FilterBlade.xyz to the Customizer and Loot Simulator :)

- Adjusted the Chancing tier list: "Ebony Tower Shield" (Tukohama's) "Glorious Plate" ("Kaom's Heart") "Gold Amulet" (Bisco's) "Rawhide Tower Shield" (Lycosidae - SPIDER SHIELD) "Sorcerer Boots" (Skyforth) "Full Wyrmscale" (Belly of the Beast)

- Added Shaper/Elder Item Treatment - 2 tiers (One for interesting "shelder" Items (ilvl 84 great bases, atlas, stygians etc., top crafting bases) and one for "all other "shelder" items"). Shaper and elder items are treated the same for now ("shelder")

- Added Abyss Jewel Treatment with extra rulesets for ILVL 84 abyss jewels

- Added Stygian Vice belts with extra rulesets for 75+ rare stygs and 84+ stygians

- Added all the new divination cards

- Minor updates to the leveling section

- Adjusted all map tiers to work with the new "ShapedMap" mod

- Adjusted the crafting and T1/T2 rares to have a slightly higher focus on sceptres. Also did some minor adjustments, removed some T2 rares.

- Retiered all Divination cards [NOTE: Economy data based upon mix from early Harbinger economy and some predictions, based on patch notes and experience from past leagues. I'll update the filter ASAP to reflect the real economy.]

- Retiered all uniques [NOTE: Economy data based upon mix from early Harbinger economy and some predictions, based on patch notes and experience from past leagues. I'll update the filter ASAP to reflect the real economy.]

- Gave annulment orb a more permanent place.

- Several other small improvements

----------------------------------
NeverSink's itemfilter - version 5.3 - Further Levelling Optimizations! FilterBlade goodies: Filter Sharing/Cloud Storing, Customizer Improvements!
----------------------------------

- Fine-tuned the levelling section based upon user feedback and my HC Turmoil league experience!

- 3-links are now more strict.

- Reduced the number of magic trinkets later on.

- Added ruby/topaz rings to the early high highlight rings sections (for the +1 caster recipes)

- Early Life flasks are highlighted as good for one additional level

- The levelling section shows less magic items now

- T2 endgame trinkets are now correctly hidden on higher strictness versions.

- Very slightly updated the divination cards and uniques (barely anything changed, economy is super stale)

- Minor structure improvements

**FilterBlade changelog:**

- [**Save State Sharing!**][**Cloud Saving**] On the Save&Load screen, you can now publish your save on our server and also let others access it! We're going to add a "top subversion" table soon too! Streamers can use this to share their subversion ("normal" users can do the same).

- [**Resource Minimizer**]: This should improve performance by A LOT! It also fixes a weird loading bugs where files were not loaded correctly.

- [**Customizer Levelling Section Improvements**]: Simplified several settings and made everything much more intuitive and well explained.

- Added the Item ReCreation tool below the loot simulator. use Ctr+C to copy an in-game item and paste it into the box to re-create it in filterBlade and directly edit the rule it's been matched by + see info about the rule and WHY it matched the item. great for cases where you ask yourself: "why does the filter highlight this item?" -> Ctrl+C -> paste -> "oh, it's a warband item, nice, let me quickly edit some of those colors, ..."

*Notes about the server side saving: we don't care and don't collect any personal data (merely a footprint to prevent users from spamming saves). However, we do reserve the right to delete and analyze any save-states to find bugs in the system and to improve the website. You also don't technically *own* the saves. This section is highly experimental. If anything breaks let us now. You can still use the local save option too!*

----------------------------------
NeverSink's itemfilter - version 5.21 - Added dropsounds for 4-links while leveling!
----------------------------------

- Added dropsounds for 4-links while leveling :)

----------------------------------
NeverSink's itemfilter - version 5.2 - Racing Update, completely new levelling section, HUGE FilterBlade update
----------------------------------

**Filter changelog:**

- COMPLETELY, entirely reworked the levelling section. It is now much more strict, has more prominent highlights. It took a lot of trial and error and feedback to get it a state, I was pleased in.

- Added a leveling section specific dropsound.

- Introduced a lot of flask-related changes. New Utility Flask Background color

- Rebalance the sizes of a lot of items

- Merged some redundant filter sections

- Disabled some redundant sections

- Completely retiered all uniques

- Completely retiered all divination cards - several new cards added to the T5 layers

- Retiered all rares. It now contains more high attack speed bases, more shields and has become more strict in a few other sections.

- Chayula/Uul-Nethol Blessings now have their own appearance

- Chayula splinters have a stronger highlight

- Rebalanced the distribution of map fragments (Guardian fragments are now longer T1)

- I probably forgot to list a lot of changes. I'm sleepy, but this is one of the largest updates so far.

**FilterBlade changelog:**

- [New Tiers]: You can now add new tiers into existing tierlists (example: Currency, Chancing Bases, ...)

- [Improved Augmentations]: "Augmentations" - rules added by the user - now also support multi-rules. (e.g.: You can have multiple different "Highlight and Hide Rares" rulesets)

- [Full Rare Item Coverage]: The customizer now detect all rare rules, including T3 and T4 settings.

- [More Options]: Added tons of new options, tools and gadgets to play around with. It'
s way too much to cover. I'm sure you'll discover some :). We tried covering all (sensible) requests.

- [Performance Optimizations]: In short: It's. so. much. faster. Switched to cached async queries, improved the loading strategy, optimized queries and reduced algorithm complexity, refactored the autocomplete UI imlementation and did a ton of other performance improvements. Next update we're minimizing our assets.

- We also updated the file requesting system. this should boost loading times if you access FilterBlade from e.g. South America (feedback appreciated since we obviously cant verify this outself)

- [Filter Structure]: (Prototype) The advanced screen now maps the entire filter. It's not quite ready yet and doesn't use the existing save/load system yet. Tell us what you think.

- [Armortype Filtering]: (Prototype) You can now highlight by item type, such as "ES armors".

- (experimental) Save State Visualization. Display all changes in your current save-state in a list. Find it on the advanced screen

- Tons of bug fixes! Most were very niche, but we addressed every known bug in our todo-list. We're sure you'll eventually find some new ones, feel free to post/mail those. (Note: those were minor things like "reset button sometimes doesn't work" or "something was laggy". We hotfix anything that affects the actual generated code or ingame aspects).

- The performance improvements allowed us to replace all "simple" editors in the customizer (the ones without color pickers etc.) with the normal ones.

- Added a ToolTip for TagList + Drag&Drop lists. It's quite handy for T1/T2 rares and leveling basetypes.

- Added a "BaseType list" for dropLevel sliders to see the affected basetypes

- Users can switch between screens using the following keys: A/D, left/right, 1-7.

- Added 2 new functions to the Quick Functions and the Command Builder (Advanced) to increase/decrease font sizes by a flat value

- The slider in the "Compact Overview Mode", now has fixed steps.

- Extracted the Save/Load UI to a screen of it's own and moved the "Code" screen into "Advanced".

- Updated the Overview screen a bit (also added a new box with explanation for rare color identifiers: border, background and text)

- Improved the saveStates: now correctly updates info and deletes invalidated changes

- Improved the invalidation system, added a method to keep appearance-related changes for smaller updates.

- Fixed a bug in the loot simulator that caused items to be displayed incorrectly if they had 2 ItemLevel lines with different operators (such as "ItemLevel < 65" AND "ItemLevle > 5" in one rule). This did not affect anything ingame, yet it displayed some items that should've been hidden.

- Implemented additional internal markers that tests filter syntax for invalid/"stupid" values.

----------------------------------
NeverSink's itemfilter - version 5.1.1 - Further improvements, meta adjustments, sound adjustments.
----------------------------------

- Due to ALL the new dropsounds introduced by GGG being bugged/silent/not audible, I've changed the map-sounds-scheme again. 
- Changed the map drop sound for T11-T15 maps to PlayAlertSound 5 - you won't be missing this one.

----------------------------------
NeverSink's itemfilter - version 5.1 - Fixes and economy adjustments 
----------------------------------

-Removed the new shaper-announcer-sounds from the filter and returns the old dropsounds to exalts/mirrors/divines. The sounds were buggy and way too silent. I might make a new subversion with those if GGG fixes them, but for now I won't be using them. I've certainly learned my lesson, when it comes to using new tech
- Wisdom scrolls now show again on semi-strict. I wasn't aware that so many people started right ahead with semi-strict. I apologize for not announcing this earlier.
- T11-15 maps and harbinger shards get to keep the new sounds. They seem to work fine. I've remove them too if I'll get reports about them not working right.
- Adjusted the sizes of T3/T4 rare items in the endgame. They now look slightly differently and are significantly larger. This affects the regular/semi-strict version. The low-strictness versions should feel much more "2.6"-y, when it comes to endgame rares.
- Adjusted the strictness/tiering of some rares to match the meta more.
- Divine/Eternal flasks are now shown for a longer time. They're now also visible in low tier maps on the regular/semi-strict version.
- Made portal and wisdom scrolls sli
ghtly smaller and changed their look a bit to better fit the filter style
- Retiered and adjustment the appearance of harbinger shards to fit the filter style and their price better.
- Readjusted the prices of all uniques/divination cards. Note that the economy is VERY volatile and you might wanna update again in 3-4 days, because a lot of prices are likely gonna change.
- Increased the font size of divine vessels (also: added an explicit entry, because people keep spamming me about it. Just because you can't "ctrl+f" something, doesn't mean it's hidden, it was caught by class. Ancient Relic Key story all over again... )
- Improved the map highlighting a tiny bit.

----------------------------------
NeverSink's itemfilter - version 5 - Fall of Oriath 
----------------------------------

- Reworked several parts of the filter
- Completely reworked the rare section - it now has "only" 4 tiers, handpicked meta T1 items, handpicked meta T2 items, droplevel based T3 items and "other items" for each class (T4)
- Removed the red ugly background from rares
- The filter is much much more strict overall
- The "very strict" strictness is now more restrictive than the old "uber strict" version
- Added a new strictness: "UBER-PLUS-STRICT". It should be tight enough for whatever pinatas the league has to offer.
- Did small improvements nad changes to the leveling algorithm, more coming in later versions. In general it's more strict, more selective
- Increased the sizes of most items you'd generally pick up anyway. Most currency items are now size 40+ (this is a buff)
- Added all the new harbinger stuff
- Retiered the rares
- Retiered the uniques
- Didn't retier the divination cards - I'll do it once the meta stabilizes
- Added a new section for the bone spirit shield for summoners
- Added a new section for chayula splinters
- Implemented a new dropsound for maps T11-T15
- Implemented Shaper voice announcemnets for Mirrors, Divines and Exalted orbs
- Lots of other minor changes, I forgot a lot probably o.O 

- Did all possible adjustments to filterblade to support or even all of those changes.

----------------------------------
NeverSink's itemfilter - version 4.72 - Polishing 
----------------------------------

- Improved the atlas colors. T1 atlas bases under level 84 look better now.
- Did some minor structure changes to the leveling section

----------------------------------
NeverSink's itemfilter - version 4.71 - Polishing 
----------------------------------

- Adjusted divination cards and unique tier lists
- Reworked the quality flask section - it's now split into an endgame and a levelling part
- Replaced all 198 occurances of "levelling" with "leveling". Yep.
- Reworked the Atlas Section to be centralized at 1 spot.
- Removed some minor redundancies
- Fixed some minor style bugs

----------------------------------
NeverSink's itemfilter - version 4.7 - Bugfixing
----------------------------------

- Retiered all divination cards and uniques
- [Silver Coin] and [Glassblower's Bauble] moved down to the Alteration/Chromatic/Jeweller/Chance orb tier, at least for the duration of legacy league.
- [Scouring Orb] moved up a tier to the Chaos Orb tier, at least for the duration of legacy league.
- Uber-Strict T4 Divination cards, no longer play a drop sound (experimental, tell me what you think - this includes cards such as gambler, her mask, emperor's luck and around ~50 others, with the value of <1C. You'll still see them, but no sound).
- Uber-Strict normal, non-"good" ("Perandus" "Breach" "Nemesis" "Bloodline" "Beyond" "Onslaught" "Domination") no longer play a dropsound
- Moved all sextants to a new temporary T1.5 tier, at least for the duration of legacy
- Removed some redundant lines
- Added "Beyond", "Domination" and "Onslaught" to the list of good leaguestones
- Fixed a small bug that hid some Chromatic recipe items during levels 60-64 on semi-strict
- The Uber-Strict version shows around ~50% less rares now.
- Added a Red Background, white text entry for corrupted 6Ls (normal 6Ls remain white)
- Added a bordercolore to tabula (it had the right background+sound, but the wrong border)

----------------------------------
NeverSink's itemfilter - version 4.63 - Bugfixing
----------------------------------

- Hotfixed a bug in 4.62, that didn't highlight rare 6-links correctly (it highlighted them as 6S, instead of 6L)
- Moved emperor of purity a tier down
- Removed the custom purple style currency color for now. I'll change it to something else later.

----------------------------------
NeverSink's itemfilter - version 4.62 - Polishing update, Purple/Necrotic style added, Filterblade teaser.
----------------------------------

- Added the purple (Necrotic) style. It includes all strictness subversions and is very breach/prophecy themed.
- Some divination and unique tier list improvements
- Increased the tier of Skean daggers
- Shard/Scroll fragment visibility improved, to adjust the filter to the transmogrifying tempest
- The Uber-Strict filter now hides, transmutations and blacksmith whetstones
- Changed the ancient relic key color from green/white to orange/white. I somehow didn't include this change in the last update.

----------------------------------
NeverSink's itemfilter - version 4.6 - Legacy League - Major update
----------------------------------

Features:

- Retiered and repriced all uniques.
- Retiered divination cards and added 2 new cards to the tierlists
- Adjusted the leveling section a lot. It now has better highlights for 4L, useful racing gear, some flasks, "brutus-killing-equip" etc.
- Adjusted the chance bases
- Completely reworte the map tier lists. The new map tier list shows low tier maps, and highlights them, WHEN you are in lowtier maps. Once you outlevel the map drops (7 levels difference between the droptier and the itemlevel) the map becomes "greyed out" and hidden on high strictness version of the lootfilter. The exceptions are maps of tier 10 or higher (never hidden) and all shaped maps.
- Adjusted several colors, settings, lot's and lot's of finetuning
- Gems with 14%+ qual are now more visible
- Lot's of minor adjustments to the structure, that improve the performance and allow me to generate the filters easier.
- Fixed the blue/slick styles, sometimes still having some "old" green backgrounds.
- Added a new "streamsound" style, that has an alt. soundsscheme - it's designed for streamers and streamviewers to not get confused when the other side find a good item.
- Adjusted the rare tierlist towards the upcoming economy
- Adjusted the crafting bases towards the upcoming economy
- Made the semi-strict filter more strict towards 2-handed and bulky bases. 
- Some stylistic and performance improvements - updated my tools to use "tierlists" that group together different levels, basetypes, classes for easier editing

----------------------------------
NeverSink's itemfilter - version 4.5 new version, major meta and toolchain adjustments.
----------------------------------

- Refined **all** filters to match the meta/economy more
- Adjusted the unique tier list
- Renamed the filenames a tiny bit so that they're ordered correctly.
- Added a new version: "Very Strict". It's about as strict as the old Uber-Strict, but fits the economy better. If you liked Uber-Strict before, you should probably stick to this version now.
- The Uber-Strict filter is now even **more** strict (double-dips!) and only shows the meta-rares.
- The strictness gap between Regular<->Semi-Strict has been increased a bit, while the one between Semi-Strict<->Strict decreased a bit.
- Improved my mini-toolchain to allow quicker and more frequent updates
- Adjusted font-sizes to be slightly more uniform

Feature Balance:

- Finetuned the T1-rares to match the meta. They're mostly consisting out of ES items.
- Added the T1.5 rares. These rares are shown in every version, but will have a black background in the Uber-Strict version instead of green.
- Finetuned the T2-rares to match the meta.
- Finetuned the good/ok/bad rare balance. It's more strict in general.
- Reworked the dagger tier lists (more high tier daggers shown)
- Reworked the sceptre tier lists (Void and Sambar sceptre are now T2 bases)
- Harbingers and spike-point quivers moved a tier down.
- ILVL 84 Steel/Opal/Crystal belts now give off the T1 Drop sound
- Refined the section handling rare Atlas bases
- Chancing items now have priority over the regular crafting section. However, the 84+ crafting section still has priority over the chancing items
- Removed Jewelled foil from the T1 crafting (and crafting rare) items to the T2 crafting items.
- Fixed several minor bugs
- Added 20% qual. shields/daggers to the 20% section
- Removed a few redundant entries
- Changed the default "Animated Weapon"-items appearance. The items are now way small, because most meta-AW builds rely on cast while channelling or totems.
- Potential warband items and corrupted white amulets/belts (for "corrupted alchemy darkshrine" in labs) are not shown by default on the Very Strict and higher versions (still shown if you hold alt.)
- Made the hidden items even smaller. (the ones you see while holding ALT)

----------------------------------
NeverSink's itemfilter - version 4.43 minor update
----------------------------------

- Added the divination cards to the tierlists
- The regular filter now displays the two-stone/onyx/diamond trinkets starting with level 60.
- Minor change to T2 currency visuals (still experimenting).

----------------------------------
NeverSink's itemfilter - version 4.42 economy/polishing update
----------------------------------

- Removed the Unique T2 Lapis Amulet from the tierlists.

----------------------------------
NeverSink's itemfilter - version 4.41 economy/polishing update
----------------------------------

- Due to popular request the priority chancing section is no longer hidden in the strict version (uberstrict still hides it)
- Added the Spiraled Foils to the good rare items.


----------------------------------
NeverSink's itemfilter - version 4.4 economy/polishing update
----------------------------------

I've attempted to work with Poe.Ninja instead of Poe.Trade for the price checking of different uniques/divination cards. I initially like the results.

CHANGES:

- Retiered all divination cards to better fit the current economy
- Retiered all uniques to better fit the current economy
- Increased the itemsizes of several low-mid tier orbs to fit the breach pinatas and the clearspeed meta
- Alterations, chance, jeweler and chromatic orbs now have more highlight ( https://imgur.com/a/0f1D6 )
- Added all corrupted belts to the show-list (amulets already there).
- You can now again click alt to check the ground for warband items (you don't need to do it in the T13/T15 maps)

BUGFIXES: 

- Fixed the highlight for finished "Breachstone" items. The official information is that they are "Map Fragments". They are not. This is client-side a bug. It's not major, but worth investigating to prevent future problems /u/GGG_Bex
- ilvl75+ Spike point quivers now have the correct textcolor
- ilvl75+ 6S armors now have the correct textcolor
- Restructured a tiny bit - leather belts (for chancing) are now visible 

----------------------------------
NeverSink's itemfilter - version 4.31 minor bugfixes and improvements
----------------------------------

- Added leather belts to the chancing lists
- Quality gems with less than 14 quality now have a border again (oops)
- ilvl 50+ crudebows for SRS crafting now only get the green border if they're non-unique

----------------------------------
NeverSink's itemfilter - version 4.3 breach & architecture overhaul
----------------------------------

Special thanks to GGG and Bex&Jonathan in specific for forwarding and answering my questions about the filtering algorithm. You guys rock!

STYLES:

- The filter now supports styles!
- Styles are alternative filters, with the same 4 strictness versions (regular, semi-strict...), but with different visuals
- The Slick Filter - is now a whole style and has all 4 strictness versions!
- Added new style: (BLUE) - same as regular, bad rares have a transparent background and good rares a blue one. First style to test the feature :)
- The styles are located in folders, starting with (STYLE)

CHANGES:

- Added breach rings
- Added breachstones, breach blessings (shouldn't those be curses, I mean those guys are kinda hellish), splinters
- Added vaal breach with a little bit of extra highlight
- Revamped the warband item section. 
- ILVL 82 identified, noncorrupted boots and helmets and ILVL 84 sceptres, wands and daggers will be treated as warband items and will have a light purple border
- Adjusted some colors
- Made the filter a bit stricter
- Reworked the crafting tier list - removed less demanded items, added foils
- Moved rare foils up several tiers
- Adjusted divination card tier list
- Adjusted unique tier list
- Removed dropsounds from lvl1 and 2 essences
- Moved journeyman sextants up a tier

STRUCTURE:

- Completely reworked the filter structure - based on the official information provided by GGG_Jonathan
- The new structure should be -significantly- faster. I suspect that the time needed to classify an endgame drop is 10 times smaller or even faster. This is a buff.
- Added a polished table of contents, that is auto-updated, thanks to a little C# tool.
- The filter syntax is a LOT more cleaner and commented now. The filter file has become a tiny bit larger, but this should not affect performance, since comments are not only parsed during the initial load (confirmed by GGG_Jonathan)
- Added comments and descriptions to every visual identifier: those are autoupdated, thanks to the same tool.
- The filter now supports alternative stylesheets (guess the tool). Those are located in folders called (STYLE) *stylename* and also have the 4 basic subversions (regular, semistrict, strict, uberstrict)
- The stylesheets are also kept up to date and provide the filter with a different appearance.
- For now only the "blue" stylesheet is added. More stylesheets coming soon.
- The new filter structure is easier to edit for users and easier to maintain for me
- Fixed several rare bugs

STYLE:

- Polished up the appearance of the filter thanks to the stylesheets. Removed or grouped similar colors, to provide a more uniform, polished appearance
- Implemented the new warband items. Identified boots and helmets of the ilvl 82 and sceptres, daggers and wands of the ilvl 84 will now appear with a special border
- Fix a few bugs.

----------------------------------
NeverSink's itemfilter - version 4.2 (for POE 2.4/atlas POLISHING UPDATE)
----------------------------------

**GENERAL** :

NOTE: The slick version is not updated in this version. Reason can be found below.

I've finally finished a small tool that auto-generates non-regular versions for me, allowing me to update easier, safer, introduce better filtering mechanics (as seen in this update) into the non-regular versions and potentially have more versions.

This update improves the filtering of the semi-strict/strict/UBERstrict a lotversions, reintroduces warband helmets markup (high level only, see below), adds a new block for highlighting selected 6S ilvl 84/83 items, slighlty improves the markup of maps and currency and fixes some bugs.

The next update will enable me to have easy stylesheet and color-table generations, I'll update the slick version, once it's done.

**Filterversions** :

- **Regular** - displays all rares
- **Semi-Strict** - hides all "*/bad rares" in the endgame and also all "clunky/ok" rares. Also hides clunky chromatic recipes, still shows gavels and a very small asortment of crafting trinkets (twostone, onyx, diamond)
- **Strict** - hides all non-good and even the good/2h items that are not top-tier. Recommended for large parties and heavy magic find characters. NOT recommended for beginners.
- **UBER-Strict** - [**NEW**] Crazy filtering level. You've been warned. It displays only the Creme de la Creme. Hides >90% rares, portals, wisdoms, armorers, agumentations, most recipes etc.
- **Slick** - same as regular, however less colors.

You can get more information and the filter itself:

Or you can get the filter directely from my GITHUB

If you want the notepad++ highlighting you can also find it on GITHUB

**NOTE:** Currently there exists a bug, that causes some fonts to appear weird ("empty boxes", distance between letters distant or wrong letters). This bug is caused by the POE engine itself and is not related to the filter (it can happen with other filters or even without them in other game parts too). If this happens to you: restart the game and it should be all gone. Please stop E-Mailing me about it, there's sadly nothing I can do, since this is client-related. GGG is aware of the bug.

----------------------------------
CHANGELOG:
----------------------------------

**CONTENT:**

- Added the UBER-strict version. You can find more details in the version description above.
- The code is now even more tidy, displays correctly in NotePad and is easier to keep up-to-date.
- Improved the filtering of the Semi-Strict version. It's a little bit more strict now
- Improved the filtering of the Strict version. It now differs between top tier and other items (the other items have no green backgrounds)
- The strict version now has a significantly smaller 83/84 crafting item list.
- Added Kris to the crafting lists
- Updated all versions to switch to non-leveling-mode at level 66. The dried lake is now a tiny bit cleaner. 
- Added 4 cards to the "trash-tier" divination cards (hermit, king's blade, prosperity, metalsmith's gift). They no longer give off sounds. I apologize if this upsets the creaters of those cards.
- Added new section that highlights selected ilvl 83/84 bases.
- Added a section for redblade warband helmets. To see them, you have to click alt/F (or whatever the key to display hidden items is for you). Magic helmets (ilvl 80+) will get highlighted in a red hue. Note that this affects ALL helmets, no matter who dropped them. Only use this when fighting redblade warbands (beacon map). If you want to enable other warbands you can do it in the code manually

**VISUAL:**

- Changed up some item-sizes (maps mostly to distinguish different map tiers better)
- Low maps have a weaker background
- Mid-High currency (chaos, vaal, regret, GCP, regal and some special ones) have a slightly more orangish hue on drop. -  I'm considering reintroducing the GONG sound on those, feedback welcome.

**SOUNDS:**

- Guardian map fragments don't give off the high-tier-item sound anymore (they still have the white background). The drop is expected and takes away a bit excitement.

**BUGFIXES:**

- This and that. I programmed 7 hours straight today and totally forgot what else I did o_O
