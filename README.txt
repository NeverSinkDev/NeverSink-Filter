FILTER VERSIONS:
--------------------------

I highly recommend starting new leagues with Regular/Semi-Strict or Strict and switching to a higher strictness if you feel like you're seeing too much.

Soft = A very low strictness version, that shows extra bases and recipes.
Regular = The normal version. Perfect for beginners and experts alike, especially if you like Chaos recipes.
Semi-Strict = Hides several bulky/bad rares. Nice balance of hidden/shown items in the endgame.
Strict = Hides the majority of all rares in the endgame. Designed for well geared players.
Very-Strict = Hides the majority of all rares in the endgame, portal scrolls, wisdom scrolls. Great for speedrunning.
Uber-Strict = Crazy filtering level. It displays only the Creme de la Creme. Hides low orbs, most rares... You've been warned.
Uber-Plus-Strict = No rares. Nothing under a chaos/alch tier. Don't complain, it's a clear screen 99% of the time.

NOTE: The filter itself will always be free, including updates. There will NOT be premium/donator versions or options!

--------------------------
STYLE VARIATIONS:
--------------------------

Different styles have the same filtering pattern and also have the same filter versions (seen above), but use different colors.
Styles can be found in the subfolders.

Purple = Heavily styled lootfilter, heavily inspired by prophecy/breach/necrotic themes.
Streamsound = Same visuals, but all sounds are different. Designed for streamers or viewers so that they don't get confused when the other side is getting an expensive drop
Slick = The normal version with less background colors (more GGG-styled). Also good for colorblind players.
Blue = Mostly the same, but the rare color scheme is tuned towards blue colors.
